# checkHaveIBeenPwned
A desktop interface to access Troy Hunt's haveibeenpwned.com site - because I was weary of hand typing addresses, and I don't know Python (I did write a Powershell script, but it's rather clumsy)

Pretty simple little util. Mostly for my own use; Still need to deal with the JSON properly if I was going to make this 
more user-friendly. And, I'd put in a elapsed-time check to make sure to avoid the 429s.

But for me, at this time, it's fine
